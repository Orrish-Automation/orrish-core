'''Test Objective''': This test shows that scenario/method can be created in pages just like page object pattern and can be used here. These scenario are defined in !-PageObject->Pages-! and are included in all tests via SetUp.
'''Status''':
'''Test case id''': <some id>

This uses Playwright so that you can run and test without depending on any Selenium grid. If you want to switch to Selenium, please change variables in SetUp to use Selenium. Look at the example !-SetUp-! in home page Web section.
